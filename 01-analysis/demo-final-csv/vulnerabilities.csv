"io.quarkus","quarkus-resteasy","CVE-2025-1634","UNASSIGNED","0.00215","A flaw was found in the quarkus-resteasy extension, which causes memory leaks when client requests with low timeouts are made. If a client request times out, a buffer is not released correctly, leading to increased memory usage and eventual application crash due to OutOfMemoryError."
"com.google.code.gson","gson","CVE-2025-53864","UNASSIGNED","0.00042","Connect2id Nimbus JOSE + JWT before 10.0.2 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a deeply nested JSON object supplied in a JWT claim set, because of uncontrolled recursion. NOTE: this is independent of the Gson 2.11.0 issue because the Connect2id product could have checked the JSON object nesting depth, regardless of what limits (if any) were imposed by Gson."
"io.quarkus","quarkus-vertx","CVE-2025-49574","UNASSIGNED","0.00041","Quarkus is a Cloud Native, (Linux) Container First framework for writing Java applications. In versions prior to 3.24.0, there is a potential data leak when duplicating a duplicated context. Quarkus extensively uses the Vert.x duplicated context to implement context propagation. With the new semantic data from one transaction can leak to the data from another transaction. From a Vert.x point of view, this new semantic clarifies the behavior. A significant amount of data is stored in the duplicated context, including request scope, security details, and metadata. Duplicating a duplicated context is rather rare and is only done in a few places. This issue has been patched in version 3.24.0."
"io.netty","netty-codec","CVE-2025-58057","UNASSIGNED","0.00052","Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In netty-codec-compression versions 4.1.124.Final and below, and netty-codec versions 4.2.4.Final and below, when supplied with specially crafted input, BrotliDecoder and certain other decompression decoders will allocate a large number of reachable byte buffers, which can lead to denial of service. BrotliDecoder.decompress has no limit in how often it calls pull, decompressing data 64K bytes at a time. The buffers are saved in the output list, and remain reachable until OOM is hit. This is fixed in versions 4.1.125.Final of netty-codec and 4.2.5.Final of netty-codec-compression."
"io.netty","netty-codec-http2","CVE-2025-55163","UNASSIGNED","0.00055","Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. Prior to versions 4.1.124.Final and 4.2.4.Final, Netty is vulnerable to MadeYouReset DDoS. This is a logical vulnerability in the HTTP/2 protocol, that uses malformed HTTP/2 control frames in order to break the max concurrent streams limit - which results in resource exhaustion and distributed denial of service. This issue has been patched in versions 4.1.124.Final and 4.2.4.Final."
"io.netty","netty-handler","CVE-2025-24970","UNASSIGNED","0.00216","Netty, an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework, has a vulnerability starting in version 4.1.91.Final and prior to version 4.1.118.Final. When a special crafted packet is received via SslHandler it doesn't correctly handle validation of such a packet in all cases which can lead to a native crash. Version 4.1.118.Final contains a patch. As workaround its possible to either disable the usage of the native SSLEngine or change the code manually."
"io.netty","netty-common","CVE-2024-47535","UNASSIGNED","0.00024","Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crashes. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.115."
"io.quarkus.http","quarkus-http-core","CVE-2024-12397","UNASSIGNED","0.00386","A flaw was found in Quarkus-HTTP, which incorrectly parses cookies with certain value-delimiting characters in incoming requests. This issue could allow an attacker to construct a cookie value to exfiltrate HttpOnly cookie values or spoof arbitrary additional cookie values, leading to unauthorized data access or modification. The main threat from this flaw impacts data confidentiality and integrity."
"io.netty","netty-codec-http","CVE-2025-58056","UNASSIGNED","0.00042","Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for development of maintainable high performance protocol servers and clients. In versions 4.1.124.Final, and 4.2.0.Alpha3 through 4.2.4.Final, Netty incorrectly accepts standalone newline characters (LF) as a chunk-size line terminator, regardless of a preceding carriage return (CR), instead of requiring CRLF per HTTP/1.1 standards. When combined with reverse proxies that parse LF differently (treating it as part of the chunk extension), attackers can craft requests that the proxy sees as one request but Netty processes as two, enabling request smuggling attacks. This is fixed in versions 4.1.125.Final and 4.2.5.Final."
"org.apache.commons","commons-lang3","CVE-2025-48924","UNASSIGNED","0.00258","Uncontrolled Recursion vulnerability in Apache Commons Lang.  This issue affects Apache Commons Lang: Starting with commons-lang:commons-lang 2.0 to 2.6, and, from org.apache.commons:commons-lang3 3.0 before 3.18.0.  The methods ClassUtils.getClass(...) can throw StackOverflowError on very long inputs. Because an Error is usually not handled by applications and libraries, a  StackOverflowError could cause an application to stop.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.18.0, which fixes the issue."
