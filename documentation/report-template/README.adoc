= Template Report Generator ‚Äì Overview & Setup
:toc:

This file demonstrates how to automate the generation of structured technical reports ‚Äì for example, for software dependency, security, or license analysis ‚Äì using a combination of templates, structured input files, and ChatGPT-based assistance.

== Goal

* Automated generation of standardized Word reports based on a prefined template
* Integration of various data sources (e.g., vulnerability scans, SBOMs, license reports, code metrics)
* Consistent formatting and structure for easy readability and auditing
* IEEE citation and reference management

== Requirements

* Template file in Word format (e.g., `Empty-Analysebericht-V1.0.docx`)
* ChatGPT instructions set
* ChatGPT prompt input based on prompt template
* Gepardec AutoUpdate analyzes data files (e.g., vulnerability scans, SBOMs, license, SonarQube reports) and/or other sources
* (Optional) Additional input files such as images or graphs
* (Optimal) Additional completed (anonymized) example reports for reference

== Required Input Files (Examples)

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| File Type | Description

| `*-vulnerabilities.json` / `.txt` | Vulnerability scan results (e.g., from Trivy or Grype)
| `*-licenses.txt`                  | License reports (if available and/or needed )
| `*-sbom.json` (CycloneDX or SPDX) | Software Bill of Materials
| `*-dependency-analysis.json`      | Resolved dependency trees and usage scopes
| `*-sonar-component.json`          | Code quality and technical debt metrics
| `.png` Images                     | Visuals (e.g., dependency trees, coverage graphs)
| IST-Zustand                       | Textual summaries of the current state of the project
| Gepardec AutoUpdate results       | Automated analysis results

== ChatGPT Prompt Input (Example)
As a prompt example, the MEGA-Backend is used and the full text-file can be found at: link:prompt.txt[Mega-Backend Example Prompt]- The
prompt is structured to guide ChatGPT through the report generation process, ensuring all necessary sections are covered and formatted correctly.

=== Sections
This chapter explains each top-level section defined in the standardized German prompt for the analysis report. Each section is identified by its `##` heading and described in terms of its role, whether it is generic or must be adapted for each report.

==== ## Titel des Berichts

*Purpose:*
Specifies the official title of the report, e.g., _‚ÄúAnalysebericht Mega-Backend ‚Äì Sicherheits- und Abh√§ngigkeitsanalyse (Vx.x)‚Äù_.

*Type:*

  *Project-specific* ‚Äì Project name and report version must be adjusted per report instance.

==== ## Ziel

*Purpose:*
Defines the general goal of the report: to technically assess the current state of the system regarding security, technology, architecture, and maintainability.

*Type:*

  *Generic* ‚Äì The goal is always the same and reused for every report.

==== ## Format & Stil

*Purpose:*
Describes the expected language (German), technology naming (original language), stylistic tone (technical, precise), formatting (`.docx`), placeholder usage, and the required IEEE citation style.

*Type:*

  *Generic* ‚Äì Uniform across all reports and not to be changed.

==== ## Verbindliche Kapitel√ºbersicht (gem√§√ü Instruktion & Formatvorgabe)

*Purpose:*
Outlines the fixed chapter structure from chapter 1 through 7. This structure is enforced and already present in the provided Word template.

*Type:*

  *Generic* ‚Äì Not modifiable and consistent for all projects.

==== ## Eingebundene Quelldateien (Pflichtintegration)

*Purpose:*
Lists the required data sources and files to be analyzed and integrated into the report (e.g., `pom.xml`, CSV files, SBOMs, Sonar exports, IST-Stand).

*Type:*

  *Partially project-specific* ‚Äì File types and expected content are fixed, but the actual values and analysis results are unique per project.

==== ## Inhaltliche Anforderungen

*Purpose:*
Specifies in detail what each report section must include: data tables, vulnerability counts, test coverage, metric thresholds, required placeholders for visual elements, and concrete values from source files.

*Type:*

  *Mixed* ‚Äì Structure and requirements are fixed, but contents (e.g., tools, metrics, CVEs) are dependent on the evaluated project.

==== ## Ausgabeformat

*Purpose:*
Specifies that the final document must be delivered as a fully populated `.docx` file using the provided layout template (`Empty-Analysebericht-V1.0.docx`) and must include all required structural and formatting elements.

*Type:*

  *Generic* ‚Äì Applies identically to all reports.

==== ## Abfolge

*Purpose:*
Describes the prescribed execution steps in generating the report, from parsing the prompt, to analyzing source data, following chapter structure, inserting placeholders, and ensuring review markers for reusable sections.

*Type:*

  *Mixed* ‚Äì Fixed procedural logic that must be followed for all reports, BUT can or in a lot of cases must be adapted to the project.

== Known Issues

* ChatGPT sometimes struggles with complex formatting in Word documents, especially when it comes to table-of-content, tables and images (therefore, for images only placeholders are placed)
* ChatGPT sometimes struggles with rendering  the Word document and has problems providing the download-Link. üí° *Solution*: Sadly, the only solution for now is to just start over again.
* ChatGPT most of the time, even told different, generates each chapter separately. üí° *Solution*: Just provided "fortsetzen" or similar commands  to continue the report generation until it is finalized
