= Template Report Generator – Overview & Setup

This project demonstrates how to automate the generation of structured technical reports – for example, for software dependency, security, or license analysis – using a combination of templates, structured input files, and ChatGPT-based assistance.

== Goal

* Automated generation of standardized Word reports based on a prefined template
* Integration of various data sources (e.g., vulnerability scans, SBOMs, license reports, code metrics)
* Consistent formatting and structure for easy readability and auditing
* IEEE citation and reference management

== Requirements

* Template file in Word format (e.g., `Empty-Analysebericht-V1.0.docx`)
* ChatGPT instructions set
* ChatGPT prompt input based on prompt template
* Gepardec AutoUpdate analyzes data files (e.g., vulnerability scans, SBOMs, license, SonarQube reports) and/or other sources
* (Optional) Additional input files such as images or graphs
* (Optimal) Additional completed (anonymized) example reports for reference

== Required Input Files (Examples)
